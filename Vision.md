## The Future We Want

### Setting the Scene

Imagine a bustling San Francisco coffee shop on a Friday early afternoon. Customers line up looking forward to their caffeine boost. The barrista is heads down concentrating on his craft focused on maintaining the premium quality that keeps customers coming everyday.

Bob is letting his single-origin Ethiopian drip breathe while he catches up on his Twitter feed. Alice calls him out, Bob smiles and greets her in return.

"Let's get down to it." Alice kicks things off.

"Good! We've got lots to cover, don't we?" Bob says in agreement.

### The Service Agreement

"We saw your brochure--the service looks good to us. How can we move this forward?" Alice asks.

"Did you install Atticus? And do you have a business profile setup?" Bob quizzes.

"I did! We have!" Alice smiles.

"Good. Let me pull up the proposal." Bob pulls his phone up in front of him, pokes at it a few times. "Here you go."

Alice's phone buzzes--she pulls hers up.

"Oh here it is! So quick!" Alice exclaims. "Lemme read it."

"It's all boilerplate terms, standard stuff." Bob says assuredly.

"I'm sure... but I'm still going to read it."

"As you should. Take the time you need."

"Alright, the terms line up with what we have in mind. The only sticking point is the rate--we feel that the additional volume involved in this deal should more than offset your fixed costs. Furthermore, with the new technology that we're integrating, this should lower expenses for both of us."

Bob pauses. "We value your business. I'm happy to arrange a discount for you. How does 10% off work for you?"

Alice gently taps the table. "Great! I accept. I'll have my staff work out the contract."

"No need," Bob answers, "you can simply edit the price by counter-proposing."

"Oh right! I forgot how useful Atticus is." She pulls up her phone again; after a few taps she looks up at Bob again.

Bob's phone buzzes. He taps a couple of times. "Signed on my end!" He says.

Alice's phone buzzes. She taps her phone. "Signed! We've got a deal!" She says smiling.

They stand up, shake hands. "That was easy!" They both say in unison.

### Arbitration

In the next table over, Charlie and David are slowly sipping their espresso macchiatos making sure their pinky fingers don't stick out.

"Why did the payment not show up?" David asks.

"I don't know. She's been on time every month. I don't know what to do." Charlie answers.

"You've been using Atticus, right? Why don't you raise a dispute?" David says, jubilant.

"Oh right! There is an arbitration clause; plus there's a penalty fee for late or missing payments." Charlie says pensively.

"Right, no need to let it linger. This is why your check bounced, right? That's cause. That's injury, damages. Right?" David encourages him.

Charlie pulls up his phone. "I've never done this... I hope it's not too drawn out. Oh well here goes."

\----

The stuffy Manila humidity feels cool and refreshing to Felipe's ears as he takes off the heavy-set noise cancelling headset. The noise of the city rushes in his conciousness--reminding him he's not in Washington, DC's fictional Underwood administration. He stares at his phone notification, then hits the Netflix pause button on his laptop.

"Great! More business. What's your legal issue today?" He muses to himself.

"This complaint looks straightforward--established habit of making payments on time over a few months, then one skipped. Let's see what the respondant has to say about it."

\----

Erica is riding the subway on her way to NYU sociology class when her phone buzzes.

"A contractual complaint against me?" She muffles to herself. "But I've been following the terms!!"

"The complaint reads that I've skipped the last monthly payment, so I'm liable to not only make up the missing payment, but also for a $20 penalty fee."

"But that's not right... we spoke about this... I'm not able to make this payment this month, I told him 3 months back, and he agreed, so long as I'd pay him eventually the full amount."

"Good thing I kept this conversation on Atticus--I can pull it from the log. That'll prove we had this conversation."

\----

Felipe pauses House of Cards once more.

"Hold on. The plot thickens. The repondant has a good excuse--the plantiff agreed to it after all! It's right here in the timeline."

\----

Charlie excitedly checks his phone as soon as he feels the buzz. "Huh... wait... my complaint has been dismissed..."

"Oh really?!" David exclaims.

"Yeah... Ah! I remember now. Wow that was a while ago, I forgot. She did talk to me about this."

"What about your damages? She's not paying the penalty?"

"No, the arbitrator explains it well, that she's not at fault and can't be held responsible for my check bouncing. So long as she follows up on all future payments and sets-off the whole balance--there's no issue here."

"Ah yeah. That's fair, I guess... are you gonna finish that macchiato?"

### The Matchmaker Business Model

"Have you run this by VCs yet?" Asks Helen.

Gary quickly pulls his flat white away from lips to answer: "No, I'm looking for advice first... that's why I asked you."

"I'm flattered."

"Now now, don't be so humble--you've got more experience with this kind of thing than most of Silicon Valley. I'd love to have you as an advisor."

"Don't remind me of my age please."

"Oh sorry sorry."

"I'm pulling your leg--but don't keep me in suspense. What's your pitch? Let's hear it!" Helen eggs him on.

Gary stretches the collar on his T-Shirt, then mimics a double karate chop on the table. "Here's what I got:"

Gary leans in: "A peer-to-peer lending system."

"I think I've heard this pitch before..." Helen leans back.

"Hasn't everybody?" Gary muses.

"What your differentiator? If you want me as your advisor, you have to have a more innovative idea than this." Helen half-smirks.

"Here's the deal: " Gary moves in and enunciates clearly. "I strictly handle the matchmaking of borrower and lender. The UX does the work of sorting out lenders matching the borrowers criteria and vice-versa."

Helen interjects: "Woah, how are you going to process the loans? How will you monitor payments? How will you cover the bunch of back-office staffers you'll need to run operations?"

Gary has Helen right where he wants her: "I don't. I use Atticus!"

Helen pauses.

Gary continues: "Once the borrower and lender agree to the parameters; i.e. interest rate, principal, payment schedule, etc. I fit them onto a Smart Contract template that's available for free on Atticus; then it runs on EOS from there--fully automated!"

Helen puts her hands up: "Stop! You have to explain this to me. How can this work?"

"It's all automated." Gary is fired up. "Each contract is viewable by the parties on Atticus once it's signed. It's got real-time accounting of each step in the loan; each payment, everything! I don't have to do any of it. The Smart Contract running on EOS takes care of it. They even get automated notices for when the payment is due, plus receipts once a payment is confirmed."

Helen is skeptical. "How expensive is this. It can't be free."

"It is... to start. Once I built enough demand where my throughput exceeds API limits, then I'll have to pay a small fee. But by then I'll be making more than enough on my transaction fees to cover for it."

Helen nods. "Ok... but we have to think about regulations. If you're settling or processing loans, you'll need licensing."

Gary bring up his index finger. "Actually, I need a legal opinion for sure... but listen to this: I'm **not** in the business of processing or settlement, my business is simply matchmaking. I don't keep custody of any funds. I don't handle payments. I don't do any of the accounting. It's all out of my hands once my system offloads it onto Atticus."

Helen is pensive. "I think you're onto something here. I guess if it's purely online, you could incorporate anywhere you want."

"Exactly! I can do... how do they say it? Jurisdiction shopping!" Greg laughs.

"Hold on, hold on!" Helen shifts gears. "This paradigm applies to all sorts of business model. Oh wow, you're onto something. Any business that is run on a contract basis, can be transitioned to this model, making it purely peer-to-peer... The possibilities are endless! Greg, you've got to take on other business models too!"

"Woah! I'm content with just being a humble... "

Helen interjects: "No no, there is some serious opportunity here. Don't sell yourself short. Who's advising you?"

"Well... you..."

"Good. Hold that thought. Lemme facetime this investor I know."

### The Escrow

Justin does a head shake. "Sorry... say that again?" Struggling to break his concentration away from the coffee press.

Iris repeats: "Where do you source your Ethiopian geisha? I've seriously gone across town looking for this."

"I source it out of Ethiopia." Justin says bluntly.

"Of course you do." Iris says with jest. "I mean which wholesaler do you get it from?"

"No no, I really mean I get it from Ethiopia. I worked out a Trade Agreement with the farmer."

"No way! How the heck did you do that? You flew to Africa?"

"No, I just happen to be connected online with him and we worked out a contract."

"You were able to trust him to ship it--and he trusts you to pay him? I never heard of such a trade deal."

"Right. We just worked out the deal on Atticus. We made it into an escrow agreement. I don't need to trust the farmer or vice-versa, we just trust the escrow."

"Explain to me what's an escrow?" Iris asks.

"We just use a lawyer." Justin says. "He receives the payment first and holds onto it until I know that the coffee beans made it here in good shape. Once that's done, the escrow then sends him the funds."

"How, like Western Union?" Iris frowns.

"He likes Bitcoin... Bitcoin Cash actually." Justin smiles. "So do I. It works out really well. The best part is... he sells it for more than he would to a wholesaler, and I buy it much cheaper than I would from a local supplier."

"No middleman! Nice! ... so how can I get in touch with him?" Iris is excited.

"I'll send you his Atticus username." Justin hesitates. "But you don't need to look up only him... just look at the marketplace."

"Marketplace?"

"Yeah, the marketplace. Atticus has loads of goods and services listed on there. You can find other farmers who put up their stock for direct sale."

"Oh I **have to** look it up!" Iris hurriedly heads towards the exit.

"Aren't you going to order something?"

## The Fact Finder

Justin scoffs, shakes his head then returns his gaze on his coffee press.

"Hey, I've been listening to your conversation just now. I hope you don't mind." Manny interjects. "Did you know there's an even better way to do your trade?"

"You're buying something, right?" Justin is clearly annoyed.

Manny lifts up his steaming Kenyan dark roast. "I love your diversity of beans... but I still prefer my own country's beans. Listen. The best way to trade is by guaranteeing the product and the payment... like you're doing. But there's a better way."

"This better be good."

"What you have now is an escrow who both checks the product and makes the payment. That's too manual. You can automate the payment part. So I say: don't use an escrow, use a fact finder."

"But I have to use an escrow, I need a human to check the beans in person." Justin frowns.

"Indeed you do, but you don't need a human to perform the payment--if the payment is sitting in a Smart Contract. Just have the human--**the fact finder**--perform the inspection of goods, then enter his finding onto the Smart Contract. The automation kicks in from there either returning you the payment if the goods are not up to standard, or the payment goes to your farmer when all is good."

"Ah I get it..." Justin tilts his head and stares blankly at the corner of his bar.

"It's much cheaper than way. A fact finder has much less work to do--and is usually cheaper. Just appoint someone you both trust... it doesn't need to be a lawyer--there's less liability involved because their not custodian of the money."

"Good. The less lawyers, the better!" Justin laughs. "You're not a lawyer, right?"

"I'm one of the good ones."

A shocked expression befalls Justin's face.

Manny continues, steamrolling Justin's bewilderment. "The legal profession can't ignore technology forever. We have to evolve too." Manny puts his business card on the counter. "Just look up my profile on Atticus, I've got some templates in there that make use of fact finders instead of escrows for international trade. They'll cut down your costs significantly."

Justin is still speechless--his mind is spinning.

Manny sets down his white porcelain cup, stands up, waves at Justin. "See you tomorrow. I'll have my Kenyan roast as usual."

## The Rental

Kelly smoothes her hair pushing it up above her brow. She thens smiles and opens her eyes up wide in recognition of Larry.

He puts his hand out for a handshake. "Hi! Thank you for making the time."

"Not at all... I love this place--good suggestion. I didn't know this was in my area." Kelly raises her latte and purses her lips and nods slowly to telegraph: 'not bad.'

"If we work things out, I'm sure I'll be here all the time." Larry emphasizes.

"Oh stop it, we've been through this. I'd love to have you and your partner in my in-law suite."

"I'm so happy to hear that--your place is fabulous."

"That's very nice of you." She unlocks her phone and shows a QR code to Larry. "I've got my terms set up here--no pets, no smoking; and I hope the rent is reasonable for you, there are outrageous market rates in this town."

"Right--not at all, I've seen higher. Your place is totally worth it! Ooo, that's an Atticus proposal? Kelly... I didn't realize you're so tech savvy."

"I'm not... it's just real simple to use." She raises her shoulder and smirks.

Larry scans the QR code. "Alright... alright... I'm good on the rent... " Larry breathes sharply, squints and reluctantly says: "could I somehow, maybe, perhaps... pay a smaller deposit? Would you entertain a couter-offer?" Larry pauses. "Oh wait... counter proposals are not enabled for this proposal... I guess that's my answer."

Kelly nods quietly. "This area is in high demand. I'm picky about my tenants, I know. But I'm afraid I'm firm on the amount."

"I'm so sorry for even asking... I love the place, I'm taking it. I'm taking it." Larry backpeddles. "Here I signed it!" He lifts his phone and waves it proudly.

Kelly's phone buzzes. "Good! Here... I'll just sign it right now."

Justin walks over: "Here's your espresso dopio."

"Can you put it in a to-go cup? We're done here! I'm moving!" Larry says excitedly while showing off his contract on his iPhone.
