## The Future We Want

### Setting the Scene

Imagine a bustling San Francisco coffee shop on a Friday early afternoon. Customers line up looking forward to their caffeine boost. The barrista is heads down concentrating on his craft focused on maintaining the premium quality that keeps customers coming everyday.

Bob is letting his single-origin Ethiopian drip breathe while he catches up on his Twitter feed. Alice calls him out, Bobs smiles and greets her in return.

"Let's get down to it." Alice kicks things off.

"Good! We've got lots to cover, don't we?" Bob says in agreement.

### The Service Agreement

"We saw your brochure--the service looks good to us. How can we move this forward?" Alice asks.

"Did you install Atticus? And do you have a business profile setup?" Bob quizzes.

"I did! We have!" Alice smiles.

"Good. Let me pull up the proposal." Bob pulls his phone up in front of him, pokes at his phones a few times. "Here you go."

Alice's phone buzzes--she pull it up.

"Oh here it is! So quick!" Alice exclaims. "Lemme read it."

"It's all boilerplate terms, standard stuff." Bob says assuredly.

"I'm sure... but I'm still going to read it."

"As you should. Take the time you need."

"Alright, the terms line up with what we have in mind. The only sticking point is the rate--we feel that the additional volume involved in this deal should more than offset your fixed costs. Furthermore, with the new technology that we're integrating, this should lower expenses for both of us."

Bob pauses. "We value your business. I'm happy to arrange a discount for you. How does 10% off work for you?"

Alice gently taps the table. "Great! I accept. I'll have my staff work out the contract."

"No need," Bob answers, "you can simply edit the price by counter-proposing."

"Oh right! I forgot how useful Atticus is." She pulls up her phone; after a few taps she looks up at Bob again.

Bob's phone buzzes. He taps a couple of times. "Signed on my end!" he says.

Alice's phone buzzes. She taps her phone. "Signed! We've got a deal!" She says smiling.

They stand up, shake hands. "That was easy!" They both say in unison.

### Arbitration

In the next table over, Charlie and David are slowly sipping their espresso macchiatos making sure their pinky fingers don't stick out.

"Why did the payment not show up?" David asks?

"I don't know. She's been on time every month. I don't know what to do." Charlie answers.

"You've been using Atticus, right? Why don't you raise a dispute?" David says, jubilant.

"Oh right! There is an arbitration clause; plus there's a penalty fee for late or missing payments." Charlie says pensively.

"Right, no need to let it linger. This is why your check bounced, right? That's cause. That's injury, damages. Yeah?" David encourages him.

Charlie pulls up his phone. "I've never done this... I hope it's not too drawn out. Oh well here goes."

\----

Felipe is binge watching Netflix as per his usual Friday evening routine in Manila. His phone buzzes; he puts the ice cream down, hits the pause button on his laptop.

"Great! More business. What's your legal issue today?" He muses to himself.

"This complaint looks straightforward--established habit of making payments on time over a few months, then one skipped. Let's see what the respondant has to say about it."

\----

Erica is riding the subway on her way to NYU sociology class when her phone buzzes.

"A contractual complaint against me?" She muffles to herself. "But I've been following the terms?!"

"The complaint read that I've skipped the last monthly payment, so I'm liable to not only make up the missing payment, but also for a $20 penalty fee."

"But that's not right... we spoke about this... I'm not able to make this payment this month, I told him this 3 months back, and he agreed, so long as I'd pay him eventually the full amount."

"Good thing I kept this conversation on Atticus--I can pull it from the log. That'll prove we had this conversation."

\----

Felipe pauses House of Cards once more.

"Hold on. The plot thickens. The repondant has a good excuse--the plantiff agreed to it after all! It's right here in the timeline."

\----

Charlie excitedly checks his phone as soon as he feels the buzz. "Huh... wait... my complaint has been dismissed..."

"Oh really?!" David exclaims.

"Yeah... Ah! I remember now. Wow that was a while ago, I forgot. She did talk to me about this."

"What about your damages? She's not paying the penalty?"

"No, the arbitrator explains it well, that she's not at fault and can't be held responsible for my check bouncing. So long as she follows up on all future payments and sets-off the whole balance--there's no issue here."

"Ah yeah. That's fair, I guess... are you gonna finish that macchiato?"

### The Matchmaker Business Model

"Have you run this by VCs yet?" Asks Helen.

Gary quickly pulls his flat white away from lips to answer: "No, I'm looking for advice first... that's why I asked you."

"I'm flattered."

"Now now, don't be so humble--you've got more experience with this kind of thing than most of Silicon Valley. I'd love to have you as an advisor."

"Don't remind me of my age please."

"Oh sorry sorry."

"I'm pulling your leg--but don't keep me in suspense. What's your pitch? Let's hear it!" Helen eggs him on.

Gary stretches the collar on his T-Shirt, then mimics a double karate chop on the table. "Here's what I got:"

Gary leans in: "A peer-to-peer lending system."

"I think I've heard this pitch before..." Helen leans back.

"Hasn't everybody?" Gary muses.

"What your differentiator? If you want me as your advisor, you have to have a more innovative idea than this." Helen half-smirks.

"Here's the deal: " Gary moves in and enunciates clearly. "I strictly handle the matchmaking of borrower and lender. The UX does the work of sorting out lenders matching the borrowers criteria and vice-versa."

Helen interjects: "Woah, how are you going to process the loans? How will you monitor payments? How will you cover the bunch of back-office staffers you'll need to run operations?"

Gary has Helen right where he wants her: "I don't. I use Atticus!"

Helen pauses.

Gary continues: "Once the borrower and lender agree to the parameters; i.e. interest rate, principal, payment schedule, etc. I fit them onto a Smart Contract template that's available for free on Atticus; then it runs on EOS from there--fully automated!"

Helen puts her hands up: "Stop! You have to explain this to me. How can this work?"

"It's all automated." Gary is fired up. "Each contract is viewable by the parties on Atticus once it's signed. It's got real-time accounting of each step in the loan; each payment, everything! I don't have to do any of it. The Smart Contract running on EOS takes care of it. They even get automated notices for when the payment is due, plus receipts once a payment is confirmed."

Helen is skeptical. "How expensive is this. It can't be free."

"It is... to start. Once I built enough demand where my throughput exceeds API limits, then I'll have to pay a small fee. But by then I'll be making more than enough on my transaction fees to cover for it."

Helen nods. "Ok... but we have to think about regulations. If you're settling or processing loans, you'll need licensing."

Gary bring up his index finger. "Actually, I need a legal opinion for sure... but listen to this: I'm **not** in the business of processing or settlement, my business is simply matchmaking. I don't keep custody of any funds. I don't handle payments. I don't do any of the accounting. It's all out of my hands once my system offloads it onto Atticus."

Helen is pensive. "I think you're onto something here. I guess if it's purely online, you could incorporate anywhere you want."

"Exactly! I can do... how do they say it? Jurisdiction shopping!" Greg laughs.

"Hold on, hold on!" Helen shifts gears. "This paradigm applies to all sorts of business model. Oh wow, you're onto something. Any business that is run on a contract basis, can be transitioned to this model, making it purely peer-to-peer... The possibilities are endless! Greg, you've got to take on other business models too!"

"Woah! I'm content with just being a humble... "

Helen interjects: "No no, there is some serious opportunity here. Don't sell yourself short. Who's advising you?"

"Well... you..."

"Good. Hold that thought. Lemme facetime this investor I know."

### The Escrow

Justin does a head shake. "Sorry... say that again?" Struggling to break his concentration away from the coffee press.

Iris repeats: "Where do you source your Ethiopian geisha? I've seriously gone across town looking for this."

"I source it out of Ethiopia." Justin says bluntly.

"Of course you do." Iris says with jest. "I mean which wholesaler do you get it from?"

"No no, I really mean I get it from Ethiopia. I worked out a Trade Agreement with the farmer."

"No way! How the heck did you do that? You flew to Africa?"

"No, I just happen to be connected online with him and we worked out a contract."

"You were able to trust him to ship it--and he trusts you to pay him? I never hear as such a trade deal."

"Right. We just worked out the deal on Atticus. We made it into an escrow agreement. I don't need to trust the farmer or vice-versa, we just trust the escrow."

"Explain to me what's an escrow?" Iris asks.

"We just use a lawyer." Justin says. "He receives the payment first and holds onto it until I know that the coffee beans made it here in good shape. Once that's done, the escrow then sends him the funds."

"How, like Western Union?" Iris frowns.

"He likes Bitcoin... Bitcoin Cash actually." Justin smiles. "So do I. It works out really well. The best part is... he sells it for more than he would to a wholesaler, and I buy it much cheaper than I would from a local supplier."

"No middleman! Nice! ... so how can I get in touch with him?" Iris is excited.

"I'll send you his Atticus username." Justin hesitates. "But you don't need to look up only him... just look at the marketplace."

"Marketplace?"

"Yeah, the marketplace. Atticus has loads of goods and services listed on there. You can find other farmers who put up their stock for direct sale."

"Oh I **have to** look it up!" Iris heads towards the exit.

"Aren't you going to order something?"
