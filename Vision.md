## The Future We Want

### Setting the Scene

Imagine a bustling San Francisco coffee shop on a Friday early afternoon. Customers line up looking forward to their caffeine boost. The barrista is heads down concentrating on his craft focused on maintaining the premium quality that keeps customers coming everyday.

Bob is letting his single-origin Etheopian drip breathe while he catches up on his Twitter feed. Alice calls him out, Bobs smiles and greets her in return.

"Let's get down to it." Alice kicks things off.
"Good! We've got lots to cover, don't we?" Bob says in agreement.

### The Service Agreement

"We saw your brochure--the service looks good to us. How can we move this forward?" Alice asks.
"Did you install Atticus? And do you have a business profile setup?" Bob quizzes.
"I did! We have!" Alice smiles.
"Good. Let me pull up the proposal." Bob pulls his phone up in front of him, pokes at his phones a few times. "Here you go."
Alice's phone buzzes--she pull it up.
"Oh here it is! So quick!" Alice exclaims. "Lemme read it."
"It's all boilerplate terms, standard stuff." Bob says assuredly.
"I'm sure... but I'm still going to read it."
"As you should. Take the time you need."

"Alright, the terms line up with what we have in mind. The only sticking point is the rate--we feel that the additional volume involved in this deal should more than offset your fixed costs. Furthermore, with the new technology that we're integrating, this should lower expenses for both of us."
Bob pauses. "We value your business. I'm happy to arrange a discount for you. How does 10% off work for you?"
Alice gently taps the table. "Great! I accept. I'll have my staff work out the contract."
"No need," Bob answers, "you can simply edit the price by counter-proposing."
"Oh right! I forgot how useful Atticus is." She pulls up her phone; after a few taps she looks up at Bob again.
Bob's phone buzzes. He taps a couple of times. "Signed on my end!" he says.
Alice's phone buzzes. She taps her phone. "Signed! We've got a deal!" She says smiling.

They stand up, shake hands. "That was easy!" They both say in unison.

### Arbitration

In the next table over, Charlie and David are slowly sipping their espresso macchiatos making sure their pinky fingers don't stick out.

"Why did the payment not show up?" David asks?
"I don't know. She's been on time every month. I don't know what to do." Charlie answers.
"You've been using Atticus, right? Why don't you raise a dispute?" David says, jubilant.
"Oh right! There is an arbitration clause; plus there's a penalty fee for late or missing payments." Charlie says pensively.
"Right, no need to let it linger. This is why your check bounced, right? That's cause. That's injury, damages. Yeah?" David encourages him.
Charlie pulls up his phone. "I've never done this... I hope it's not too drawn out. Oh well here goes."

\----

Felipe is binge watching Netflix as per his usual Friday evening routine in Manila. His phone buzzes; he puts the ice cream down, hits the pause button on his laptop.
"Great! More business. What's your legal issue today?" He muses to himself.
"This complaint looks straightforward--established habit of making payments on time over a few months, then one skipped. Let's see what the respondant has to say about it."

\----

Erica is riding the subway on her way to NYU sociology class when her phone buzzes.
"A contractual complaint against me?" She muffles to herself. "But I've been following the terms?!"
"The complaint read that I've skipped the last monthly payment, so I'm liable to not only make up the missing payment, but also for a $20 penalty fee."
"But that's not right... we spoke about this... I'm not able to make this payment this month, I told him this 3 months back, and he agreed, so long as I'd pay him eventually the full amount."
"Good thing I kept this conversation on Atticus--I can pull it from the log. That'll prove we had this conversation."

\----

Felipe pauses House of Cards once more.
"Hold on. The plot thickens. The repondant has a good excuse--the plantiff agreed to it after all! It's right here in the timeline."

\----

Charlie excitedly checks his phone as soon as he feels the buzz. "Huh... wait... my complaint has been dismissed..."
"Oh really?!" David exclaims.
"Yeah... Ah! I remember now. Wow that was a while ago, I forgot. She did talk to me about this."
"What about your damages? She's not paying the penalty?"
"No, the arbitrator explains it well, that she's not at fault and can't be held responsible for my check bouncing. So long as she follows up on all future payments and sets-off the whole balance--there's no issue here."
"Ah yeah. That's fair, I guess... are you gonna finish that macchiato?"
