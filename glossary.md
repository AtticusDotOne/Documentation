## Preamble

### Use of Terms

Terms and Definitions used herein are to be understood within the context of the related documentation.

### Note on Legal Terms

Legal terms carry special meanings, which are usually distinct from their casual meaning, or any other meaning the terms have in other disciplines.

Furthermore, as much as technical terms and their definition are generally understood to be congruent across languages and cultures, legal terms have their own operative definition in each jurisdiction--therefore, there is no universal definition for legal terms in general.

As such, legal terms as defined herein are not intended to be authoritative in any legal case. However, special care is taken so that legal terms are generally correct--albeit with an admitted English Legal Tradition bias.
